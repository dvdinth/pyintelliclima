This is a python module for communicating with the IntelliClima ECOCOMFORT 2.0 devices. 
Its main use is for my corresponding WIP HomeAssistant integration which I hope to release soon.

It can be extended to include other devices from IntelliClima in the future, but I only own the 
ECOCOMFORT, so I cannot add any others. Feel free to submit a PR for additional devices.
